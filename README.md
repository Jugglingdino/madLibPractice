# madLibPractice
# Some fun mad libs and practice I did with Ruby to familiarize myself with the language. Uploading it mostly for fun and to use as a progress marker. 
# With madLib_3 I was trying to make the interface intentionally misleading for creating a DnD inspired character sheet and potentially a small, choose your own path, text adventure.
